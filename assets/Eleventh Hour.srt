1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
- Up in the sky, look.
-It's a bird.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
- It's a plane.
- It's Superman.

3
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,200
In the endless reaches of the universe...

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,600
...there once existed a planet
known as Krypton.

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
A planet that burned like a green star
in the distant heavens.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
There, civilization was far advanced,
and it brought forth a race of supermen...

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
...whose mental and physical powers...

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
...were developed
to the peak of human perfection.

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
But there came a day when giant quakes
threatened to destroy Krypton forever.

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,200
One of the planets' leading scientists,
sensing the approach of doom...

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,400
...placed his infant son in a rocket ship
and sent it in the direction of the Earth...

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
...just as Krypton exploded.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
The rocket ship sped
through star-studded space...

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
...landing safely on Earth
with its precious burden...

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,200
...Krypton's sole survivor.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,400
A passing motorist found the uninjured
child and took it to an orphanage.

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,800
As the years went by
and the child grew to maturity...

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
...he found himself possessed
of amazing physical powers.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Faster than a speeding bullet.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
More powerful than a locomotive.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Able to leap tall buildings
at a single bound.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
The infant of Krypton is now
the Man of Steel.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
Superman.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
To best be in a position
to use his amazing powers...

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
...in a never-ending battle
for truth and justice...

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
...Superman has assumed
the disguise of Clark Kent...

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
...mild-mannered reporter
for a great metropolitan newspaper.

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Hello, Clark? Are you awake?

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll say. Who could sleep
through a racket like this?

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
well, it's been going on every night
since we've been in town.

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
What do you suppose it could be?

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
Could be sabotage, I hope.

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Me too.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
But who?

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Clark, do you suppose--?

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes, Lois?

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Nothing.

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Just a silly hunch that maybe
Superman might be over here.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Quiet. Do not talk.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,200
This sabotage must stop at once.

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Clark. Clark.

42
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
It is Superman. I just saw him.

43
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Swell chance they've got of catching him.

44
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
- Miss Lane.
- This way, please.

45
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
How does it feel to be home?

46
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Smile, please.

47
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
How about Clark Kent?
Did he get away?

48
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
No. No, he's still over there.

49
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,200
But don't worry,
Superman promised to look after him.

50
