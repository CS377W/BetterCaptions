1
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,193
Driver...

2
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,519
Driver, stop!

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,988
What type is in there?
Why do you want to stop?

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,876
The man up there. He is bleeding
to death.

5
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,190
We can't stop. Not here.

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,748
The brakes won't hold.

7
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,995
¡Orderly!

8
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,429
¡Orderly!

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,195
and just as guilty as a soldier would be
who deserted his post under fire.

10
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,599
Now in making an example of you, I...

11
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,270
I beg your pardon sir. I have some
wounded outside.

12
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,317
I am looking for the...
Oh yes, yes, yes.

13
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,517
You want the Italian unit.
We are the English unit you see.

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,990
Yes number 207.
They're in the other wing. Moved in today.

15
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,594
Yes out that way, straight ahead.

16
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,679
Thank-you Major.

17
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,591
What's the girl's friend been doing?

18
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,193
Typical male conceit.

19
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,393
I think they're going to send her
back home.
It's a dirty shame.

20
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,913
She'll be disgraced.

21
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,754
Shh, here they come.

22
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,595
Well, is it necessary for us all to be
here at one time?

23
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,398
Get back to your post.

24
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,588
You be packed and ready to leave
in one hour.

25
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,495
Molly...

26
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,593
Can I help pack?

27
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,559
I guess so...

28
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,190
If you want to.
Of course I want to.

29
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,915
Good girl.
I beg your pardon?

30
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,993
I say, she's the only human being in
the whole lot of us.

31
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,837
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to
sympathize with one...

32
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,878
...that has disgraced the uniform
that we all wear.

33
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,438
Baby!
Rinaldi!

34
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,592
Federico!
Get away. You're filthy.

35
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,912
You anglosaxons. You're not to
clean yourself.

36
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,197
Did you bring me some good kisses, baby?
Did you have trouble finding us?

37
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,750
No.
How do you feel? Is there going to
be an offensive? Were you under fire?

38
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,390
Madonna, but I worried about you!
Yes, I can see how much you've been worrying.

39
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,031
I had 7 operations today baby and
one of them was beautiful.

40
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,192
I took the heart out.

41
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,992
It lay in my hand, and beat like this.

42
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,238
You should have seen it. It was lovely.

43
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,718
Soon Rinaldi will be the best
surgeon in all the court.

44
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,236
Then in all the army,
and some day, in all of Italy.

45
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,756
Why not in all the world?
Why not?

46
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,751
You will like it here baby.

47
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,717
What sort of a town is this?
Any girls?

48
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,996
Many beautiful English nurses.

49
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,073
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley
I am in love with her.

50
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,990
Does she know it?
Not yet.

51
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,752
Have you any money?
Yes.

52
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,195
Lend me 50 lire.
What for?

53
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,750
I want to make on Miss Barkley the
impression of a man of sufficient wealth.

54
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,475
All right.
Thank-you.

55
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,393
You are my great and good friend
and financial protector.

56
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,834
And you're an ass.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,595
Now we will eat and drink and I will
take you to meet Miss Barkley.

58
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,752
But, you must make for me a good
impression upon her.

59
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,189
Now listen...

60
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,588
But you must.

61
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,352
And you can have a nurse too.

62
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,035
There is another one named Miss
Ferguson. She is very, very nice.

63
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,519
No.
No?

64
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,795
First we will eat and drink...

65
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,428
...and then we'll go and see the girls
who have never been to the front before, yes?

66
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,690
Yes.

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,038
She doesn't know.

68
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,678
Neither do I.
Oh, you've had too much wine.

69
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,990
It's filthy wine...it takes the enamel off your
teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.

70
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,354
Where was I?
Architecture.

71
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,192
Oh yes. Look...

72
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,153
...I'll explain.

73
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,310
This my dear, is called an arch...

74
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,778
The arch my dear...

75
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,376
...is perhaps the
oldest of architecturial devices.

76
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,578
Arch. Architecture.

77
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,333
The very word will tell you...

78
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,094
...how inextricably the two are one.

79
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,694
In a word my dear, Architecture...

80
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,978
...is the most ancient of the arts.

81
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,055
You'd better put your shoe on, or
you'll get cold feet.

82
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,016
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.

83
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,614
Catherine!

84
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,876
Catherine!

85
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,969
Catherine!
Here I am Fergie. I'm coming.

86
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,695
Oh, I was so worried.

87
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,697
Did you think I'd been blown away?
I didn't know what to think. Nobody
saw where you went.

88
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,097
Who's that man.

89
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,538
Oh, I don't know.Some lunatic.
Come on.

90
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,210
What if we take the mountains to
the north.

91
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,452
Behind them are more mountains,
and behind those more yet.

92
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,090
And we take them all only
if the Austrians stop fighting.

93
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,739
One side of course will stop.

94
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,097
It will go on forever.
Like him.

95
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,168
He prays for the Austrians to win the war.

96
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,173
No, no, no. It is not true.
But you don't want us to attack?

97
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,734
If we must have war, I suppose we
must attack.

98
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,935
But, so many die that way.
But what is death to a Christian.

99
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,653
Don't encourage him Fergie.

100
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,694
Frederico.

101
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,136
You are back safe.
Hello Father.
I am so glad.

102
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,895
You nearly missed the party.
But it is very dull.

103
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,290
But Miss Barkley is here and her
friend Miss Ferguson.

104
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,575
The one you will like. Come.

105
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,978
Miss Barkley, permit me to present
to you my friend and war brother...

106
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,813
...Lt. Henry. He has just
returned back from the front.

107
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,335
How do you do?

108
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,619
How do you do?

109
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,295
And this is Miss Ferguson.
How do you do?

110
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,156
How do you do?

111
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,096
Now he begins again, that fellow.
Quick let us go into the garden.

112
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,534
Now, you stay here.

113
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,691
I will fi nd something for us to drink.

114
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,056
Chianti? Grappa? Vermouth?

115
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,858
Which do you like?
All of them.

116
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,976
Then you shall have all of them.

117
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,578
I'm sorry about that. I mistook you
for someone else.

118
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,378
So I gathered.

119
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,694
I had been drinking.
I gathered that too.

120
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,288
Mad?
No.

121
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,210
You're an American, aren't you?
Yes.

122
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,696
Then what are you doing in the
Italian army?

123
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,292
It's not really the army,
it's only the ambulance.

124
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,378
It's very odd. Why did you do it?

125
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,135
I don't know. Why did you?
Oh, I joined up in England.

126
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,539
The fact is the boy I was
engaged to had gone across.

127
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,020
Where is Miss Ferguson.
Why don't you go and see?

128
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,216
Yes, do bring her out Captain
Rinaldi.

129
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,776
Have some?
Thanks.

130
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,130
He's sore.
What for?

131
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,292
Because I'm here with you.

132
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,731
Women perfer him as a rule.

133
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,739
Shall we take a walk?

134
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,368
Yes, let's.

135
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,012
Where is he now?

136
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,535
Who?
The boy you were engaged to.

137
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,055
He's dead.

138
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,058
He was killed in Assam.

139
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,449
Were you engaged long?
Eight years. We grew up together.

140
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,299
Why didn't you marry?

141
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,169
I didn't know what the war was like
then

142
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,298
If I had to do over again, I'd marry him.
Or anything...

143
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,896
When I joined up, I had this silly
idea that he may come to
the hospital where I was.

144
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,691
With a saber cut I suppose and a
bandage around his head.

145
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,418
Shot through the shoulder.

146
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,292
Something picturesque.

147
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,735
This is a picturesque front. Not
France.

148
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,052
He didn't have a saber cut.

149
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,539
They blew him to bits.

150
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,697
What are you thinking about now?
About whiskey.

151
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,053
What about whiskey?

152
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,297
About how nice it is.

153
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,299
You're nice too.

154
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,219
No.

155
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,494
Why not?
No don't.

156
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,059
Yes.
No please!

157
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,459
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's all right.

158
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,891
I'm dreadly sorry. Really.

159
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,896
I just couldn't bear the nurses'
evening off aspect of it.

160
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,691
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.

161
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,928
Poor man.

162
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,009
You see...I've been leading a
funny sort of life.

163
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,290
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

164
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,539
You don't have to talk a lot of
nonesense, I said I'm sorry.

165
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,098
We could get along.

166
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,289
Couldn't we?

167
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,614
You're sweet.

168
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,930
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are a dear.

169
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,052
I would be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

170
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,473
Did you have a nice time baby?

171
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,674
You made progress with her, eh?
We're friends. If that's what you mean.

172
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,276
I mean...was she nice to you?
Shut up!

173
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,989
I am a man of extreme delicacy, but
was she...

174
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,389
Rinaldi! Will you please shut up. If
you want to be a friend of mine, shut up.

175
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,399
I am your best friend and your war
brother.

176
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,394
Then shut up.

177
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,310
Miss Barkley prefers you to me.
That is very clear.

178
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,717
But Miss Ferguson is very nice too.

179
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,548
Do you like her?

180
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,729
No!

181
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,635
Hi, baby...

182
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,817
Good luck.

183
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,518
Turn back.
Back?

184
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,749
Yes, back!

185
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,994
I want to see Miss Barkley.
She's on duty.

186
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,278
Wait, don't go in there.

187
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,396
Why we come back here for?

188
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,835
Lt. knows what he's doing. Please.

189
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,911
What's wrong?
Aren't we going to get started here?

190
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,469
We have plenty of time.

191
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,712
I thought you started. What are you
doing here?

192
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,429
We come back Senor Capitano.
The Lt. Forgot something.

193
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,870
Hi...you're all right aren't you?

194
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,068
Yes, I'm all right.

195
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,194
I came to..

196
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,289
I thought...

197
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,089
...you see.

198
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,795
I'm going to be away for a while..

199
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,432
...and I didn't want you to think that
I'd just gone away.

200
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,896
No, I...

201
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,554
What I mean is...

202
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,952
...I'd hate to have you feel that...

203
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,394
it wasn't important to me..

204
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,313
..about us.

205
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,830
I don't exactly know how to say it.

206
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,389
You said it very nicely dear, thank-you.

207
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,589
No, no I don't mean...

208
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,030
You mustn't feel.
Will you be gone long?

209
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,376
No...

210
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,157
Only a few days. There's going to
be a show up above Plava.

211
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,993
A show? You'll be careful won't you?

212
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,515
I won't get hit.

213
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,496
Hold this.

214
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,696
Here...

215
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,398
It's a St. Anthony.

216
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,194
They sayd St. Anthony is very useful...

217
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,952
...to guard you from harm.

218
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,194
I'll take good care of him.

219
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,793
But I wish I could kiss you.

220
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,632
He is my friend and a good soldier

221
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,394
I would hate to see him lose his
head over a woman.

222
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,399
Aren't you exaggerating a bit.
I think not.

223
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,392
Couldn't we send her back to the
base, Major?

224
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,393
Oh, if you could send her away it
would simplify everything

225
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,235
Could perhaps send her to Milan.
Excellent my dear Major. Magnificient.

226
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,868
No wonder the English are first
in dipolmacy.

227
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,791
What did you say her name was?

228
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,058
We won't get anything else to eat,
once the attacks start.

229
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,892
This is all they given me.

230
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,377
Starting to eat the rations?

231
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,213
No, we'll all eat together. Come on
and sit down.

232
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,470
Thank-you.

233
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,693
Here, take some cheese.

234
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,054
Wash it down with wine.

235
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,697
Who goes to the attack?

236
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,169
Bersaglieri.

237
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,811
If nobody would attack, the war
would be over.

238
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,733
Big one...

239
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,310
420...

240
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,054
No, 305...
It sounded like a Skoda to me.

241
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,894
Skoda, that's what I say.

242
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,177
Lt.! Are you hurt?

243
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,689
My leg.

244
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,378
Both of my legs.

245
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,691
You were right Lt., it was a Skoda gun.

246
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,612
Take it easy, Now.

247
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,652
Lacerations of the scalp and
possible fracture of the skull.

248
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,291
Multiply superficial wounds of the
left and right thigh

249
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,736
...left and right knee and right
foot...

250
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,973
profound wounds of right knee and foot
in current line of duty.

251
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,893
Antitetanous please.

252
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,489
Lift him up on the table. Carefully.

253
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,499
How do you feel, baby?

254
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,499
Rinaldi...

255
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,060
What are you doing here?
Bonello telephoned to me.

256
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,651
The Major gave me permission to come.

257
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,054
No one shall hurt you baby. I won't
let them.

258
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,655
No butcher is going to touch
my war brother.

259
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,732
Only Rinaldi can take you and
never hurt you.

260
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,937
You must forgive baby, for talking
so much...

261
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,376
...but I am, I am very moved to see
you badly wounded. Hold it up.

262
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,850
I will see you are decorated for
bravery.

263
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,612
Perhaps we can get you the
medallio d'argento...

264
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,294
...but surely the bronze one.
Did you carry somebody on your back?

265
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,333
I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't
move.

266
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,377
Surely there was something very
heroic in what you did.

267
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,534
I was blown up eating cheese.

268
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,138
Don't worry baby. I will fix you so
that you are as good as new.

269
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,498
You will see, everyday, I learn to
do things smoother, quicker.

270
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,453
Soon, very soon, you will be
walking again.

271
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,052
I brought a present for you.

272
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,053
You will find it under your blanket,
next to your heart.

273
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,973
It is a bottle of brandy baby. Very
good brandy.

274
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,298
The infantry captured it from the
Austrians on San Gabrielle.

275
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,057
I have another surprise for you.

276
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,892
Take a deep breath.

277
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:52,136
Where do you think you will go from here?
To the Italian hospital where they
have the male nurses with the beards?, no!.

278
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,895
I will arrange everything with my
friend, the British Major.

279
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,609
You will go to Milan. To the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

280
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,298
That makes you happy?

281
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,577
Poor Rinaldi. So alone with the
war...

282
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,052
No one to make fun of. No one to
lend him money.

283
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,535
While you are in Milan with the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

284
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,851
Making love in Milan to the chaste
Miss Barkley.

285
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,539
Look out for the step.

286
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,894
Why do you stop?

287
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,770
I am superintendent. May I have
your medical papers please.

288
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,898
They're in my coat. In the
buttoned-down pocket.

289
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,454
Take him up those stairs, down the
corridor. His room is the one at the end.

290
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,053
You show him Julio.

291
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,294
Who are you?

292
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,051
I am the porter, Lt.

293
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,099
Come follow me.

294
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,209
Now Lt., we must lift you up on the bed.

295
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,975
All right. But keep my legs straight.
Yes, yes Lt.

296
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,854
Can I get you anything?
Get me some brandy.

297
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,738
It is not allowed.

298
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,573
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the
glory of Italy?

299
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,058
You'll find some money in my pocket.
As you wish.

300
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,217
So it's you!
Ferguson.

301
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,689
Is Catherine here?
As if you didn't know.

302
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,771
I believe that's why you got wounded.
Where is she?

303
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,329
You ought to be still.
Here's your chart.

304
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,055
I must take your temperature.
Does she know I'm here?

305
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,053
Under the arm please.

306
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,991
Hello darling.
Catherine.

307
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,111
You're lovely.
Are you badly hurt?

308
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,998
You're lovely.

309
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,559
Oh my poor darling.
It's your leg isn't it?

310
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,995
You're the loveliest
thing I ever saw.

311
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,914
I have to go now darling, I can't stay.
Will you come back?

312
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,310
Later, but we have to be awfully careful.
You've got to come back.

313
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,755
I will, when I can.
Tonight?

314
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,989
I'll try?

315
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,309
Somebody's coming.

316
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,976
Tonight.

317
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,238
I'll take that thermometer now.

318
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,639
Good gracious.

319
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,153
Fetch the doctor.

320
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,429
It's a miracle you're not delirious
with such a fever.

321
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,399
I haven't got any fever.

322
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,039
Stay quiet.

323
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,398
It's not what you think.

324
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,913
I've brought you a few little things.

325
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,958
And this is mosquito netting and
this is a bottle of vermouth.

326
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,190
You like vermouth?

327
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,438
And these are English papers.
Thank you for that.

328
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,716
It was very good of you to come.
I mustn't stay long.

329
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,518
They warned me not to tire you.

330
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,798
You seem very tired yourself.
I am tired. I have no right to be.

331
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,234
You have the war disgusted.

332
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,797
No, I hate the war.

333
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,434
I don't enjoy it.
But you do not mind it.

334
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,513
You do not see it. Oh, you must
forgive me. I know that you are wounded.

335
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,638
That was an accident.
Still even wounded, you do not see it.

336
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,357
I can tell. I do not see it myself,

337
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,999
but I feel it a little.

338
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,435
Come in Cath.

339
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,310
Don't go yet Father. It's still early.

340
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,559
Are you sure?

341
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,596
With the operation in
the morning, he should rest.

342
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,548
He's strong. He has a lovely temperature.
It is always normal.

343
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,358
I'm very proud of his temperature.

344
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,835
Maybe all of our children will have
fine temperatures too.

345
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,833
Our children will probably have
beastly temperatures.

346
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,276
Don't mind us Father. We're in love.

347
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,570
I know...

348
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,792
I can see it in your faces.

349
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,959
You approve, don't you, Father?

350
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,438
You spoke of children.

351
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,716
This too is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in Gods grace.

352
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,269
Is it not so?

353
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,189
And you?

354
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,435
I hadn't thought about it like that.

355
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,913
But...
yes, I suppose so.

356
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,793
Father, are you...

357
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,318
Is that the marriage service?

358
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,112
Poor chap.
It's such a crazy marriage.

359
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,958
At least I'm in white.

360
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,794
No orange blossoms.
I can smell them.

361
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,515
No organ music.
I can hear it plainly.

362
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,677
Yet it has made me happy to do this.

363
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,593
For now, from my heart, can I say I
bless you in His name.

364
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,954
Thank-you Father.

365
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,071
Good-bye and be happy, both of you.

366
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,549
Thank-you Father.

367
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,958
Give my regards to the mess.

368
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,680
I will.And get well soon.

369
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,229
I will come again the
next time I am in Milan.

370
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,557
Good-bye my dear.
Good-bye.

371
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,292
That's the opera I made my debut in...

372
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,849
...at La Scala.
They threw benches at him.

373
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,899
That's a lie.

374
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,209
Yes, they did. I threw six benches myself.

375
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,655
That's not funny.

376
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,173
Oh now he is offended.

377
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,491
He'll get over it. That's his sore
spot. We always tease him.

378
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,891
You don't care whom you hurt.
Now don't you get mad too.

379
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,494
Catherine and I were thinking of
asking you to our wedding.

380
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,855
Weren't we Catherine?
You'll never get married.

381
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,170
We will!
No you won't.

382
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,410
You'll fight before you marry.
Oh, we never fight.

383
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,332
You've time yet.
We won't fight ever.

384
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,219
You'll die then.
Fight or die.

385
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,049
That's what people do.
They don't marry.

386
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,335
But Fergie...

387
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,769
I'm not crying.

388
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,654
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.

389
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,989
What... Fergie...

390
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,399
What is the matter with her?

391
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,552
She doesn't like me, that's all.
Oh no. She just likes me more.

392
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,591
Are you on night duty tonight?

393
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,115
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.

394
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,157
You wait and see...

395
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,197
Darling...how many other girls
have you ever loved?

396
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,990
None.
How many, really?

397
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,010
None.

398
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,268
How many have you... loved?

399
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,679
None.
you're lying to me.

400
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,028
Of course.
That's right...

401
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,919
...just keep on lying,
that's what I want you to do.

402
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,639
Were they pretty?

403
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,872
I've never been with anyone.
That's right darling.

404
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,472
What were they like?
I don't know anything about it.

405
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,749
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.

406
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,150
I don't care if you have though.
I'm not afraid of them.
Only don't tell me about them.

407
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,989
You never told them you loved them, did you?
No.

408
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,991
I knew you wouldn't.

409
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,871
Oh darling, I do love you.
Then, kiss me.

410
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,158
Right here on the street?
Yes.

411
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,758
I'll go in first.

412
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,911
What is this? If I may ask.

413
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,513
What was in it.

414
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,997
That's Kümmel. That's the best kind. It comes
in those bear shaped bottles from Russia.

415
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,388
And these.

416
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,835
That's brandy, wine and whiskey.

417
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,753
And I have been pitying you for
being wounded.

418
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,839
Pity is something that is wasted on you.
Thank you.

419
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,195
If you're so anxious not to go back
to the front...

420
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,590
...I should think you'd try
something more intelligent.

421
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,876
Not self-inflicted alcoholism.

422
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,996
What?
I said alcoholism.

423
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,677
And I also say, that I'll see your
convalescent leave is canceled.

424
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,995
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.

425
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,730
Have I time for a drink before the train leaves?
For the front?

426
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,095
Yes.
In about 20 minutes signore Capitano.

427
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,375
You're a fine simple girl.
I am a simple girl.

428
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,417
Nobody but you ever realized it.

429
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,650
At first, I thought you
were a crazy girl.

430
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,572
I was a little crazy at first.

431
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,495
Is that your train?
Maybe...

432
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,373
It makes a bell to ring...

433
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,100
...But stays in the
station here until time to leave.

434
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,657
There's really lots of time.

435
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,729
"But at my back, I always hear...

436
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,494
time's winged chariot hurrying near..."

437
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,090
I know that poem. It's by Marvell.

438
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,116
Listen.

439
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,779
It's only the rain.

440
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,159
I hate the rain.

441
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,829
I like it.

442
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,592
I'm afraid of the rain.

443
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,838
Afraid, why?
I...

444
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,998
Oh, perhaps it's silly.
What? Tell me.

445
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,798
No. Don't make me.
Tell me.

446
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,489
All right.

447
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,391
I'm afraid of the rain, because
sometimes I see me dead in it.

448
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,799
No!

449
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,394
And sometimes I see you dead in it.

450
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,674
Well that's more likely.
Oh no darling, don't say that.

451
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,393
That is your train.

452
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,876
"Time's winged chariot".

453
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,590
I'll come with you.
No, please, I don't want you.

454
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,752
Not at the station.

455
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,399
All right darling.

456
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,111
How often will you write?
The often as I can.

457
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,192
Do they read your letters?
They can't read English enough to
head any.

458
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,432
Well I'll make them very confusing.
But not too confusing.

459
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,796
Oh, I should have got you a
going-away gift.

460
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,996
A whistle to make you feel better in
the dark.

461
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,436
Or a sword. I'm sure we could get
a used sword very cheap.

462
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,919
Swords aren't very useful at the
front.

463
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,753
Oh I see, they get in the way of
your legs when you are running.

464
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,991
They might be useful at mess
though.

465
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,157
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.

466
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,911
I hate to leave our fine house.

467
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,754
So do I.

468
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,354
We never stay settled very long in a
home, do we?

469
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,995
We will.

470
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,234
I'll have a fine home for you when
you come back.

471
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,750
Say I'll come back to Catherine.

472
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,119
I'll come back to Catherine.

473
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,392
I'll always come back.

474
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,398
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt
just a little in the foot.

475
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,310
Or the lobe of the ear.
Oh no. I want your ears just the
way they are.

476
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,392
Your feet have been hurt already.

477
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,553
I want a ticket to Switzerland, please.
To where Signora, to what town?

478
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,393
The nearest one to Italy.
That would be Brissago, signora.

479
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,312
Then give me a ticket to Brissago.
All right.

480
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,908
Oh Fergie, I was afraid you wouldn't
come.

481
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,832
Would you mind telling me what this
is all about?

482
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,992
I'm going away.
So I gathered by this, but...
...Where, why...

483
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,158
What would be the good. It would only
worry him and he would have to go anyway.

484
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,079
Aren't you going to tell him.
Well, not yet.

485
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,549
I may write him from Switzerland.

486
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,396
You're a fool.
Here Signora.

487
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,758
On track three.
Thank-you.

488
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,957
What's the hurry? Why tonight?
I couldn't go back to that hospital.

489
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,519
I couldn't stand it. Not with him
gone.

490
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,434
But you'll be all alone in Switzerland...
Now don't worry Fergie, I'll be all right.

491
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,599
You're not afraid of anything are you?

492
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,795
Only of going back to that hospital.

493
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,995
Don't scold me Fergie.

494
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,759
I'll carry it.

495
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,995
I've always told you I was a crazy girl...

496
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,196
I couldn't bear Milan while you were away.

497
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,555
So, I've chucked the war and come
to live in this little Swiss town...

498
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,632
...as near as possible to the
Italian border...and you.

499
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,715
And darling, it's an adorable place
and we'll be very happy here.

500
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,030
I've taken a suite...

501
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,835
...in the best hotel.
And I am fairly wallowing in luxury.

502
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,396
The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.

503
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,119
There is a maroon velvet carpet,
ankle deep... and a bathroom...

504
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,911
...oh darling the bathroom. It's a
black marble, with silver fittings.

505
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,394
I've just dined in state, at my
sitting-room window.

506
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,597
From which there is a divine view
of the lake, shimmering in moonlight.

507
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm an awful liar darling...

508
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,272
It's not really a nice place at all.
It's mean, cheap and horrible.

509
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,192
But it doesn't matter where I live...

510
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,193
...because I don't really live at all,
when I'm not with you.

511
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,548
Darling...

512
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,799
What I really want to tell you is...

513
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,189
...I shall lie awake in the dark
and cry because you are not here.

514
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,236
I'm lonely and frightened.

515
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,078
And I love you.

516
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,993
Hurry baby.
Why?

517
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,991
It's time to go.
Go where?

518
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,391
But I told you before to the Villa
Rosa. New girls. Everybody is going.

519
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,516
No, not me.
But you must.

520
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,353
It will be a fine party
and besides I said that you would go.

521
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,556
I can't. I've got to write a letter.

522
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,591
To that little...everyday, more
letters.

523
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,159
You might as well be married.

524
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,639
That's my business.

525
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,718
Oh baby. How are you ever going
to come back to me?

526
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,440
Serious, like a shopkeeper with a
liver.

527
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,388
Where is my war brother, who used
to get drunk with me and go to
the Villa Rosa every night?

528
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,879
Leave me alone, will you?

529
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,874
Why? Isn't she just a girl?

530
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,392
Keep her out of this.

531
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,193
Secret subject.

532
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,478
Believe me baby secret subjects
are not good for soldiers.

533
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,073
Why don't you be like me? All fire
and smoke.

534
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,358
And nothing inside. Come on baby.
You're drunk, stop it.

535
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,397
Of course I am drunk.

536
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,870
You come with me and you will be
drunk too. Come on baby.

537
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,313
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come.

538
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,629
There is no more ink.

539
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,072
Get your hands off me and get out!

540
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,559
Poor baby...

541
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,678
Tomorrow I will get you drunk,
and I will take out your liver

542
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,515
...and I will put you in a good Italian
liver and make a man of you again.

543
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,475
Ciao baby

544
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,796
You're going out Signore Capitano?

545
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,392
Yes, why?
The mail just came, Signore Capitano.

546
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,070
You censure it.
Signore Capitano...

547
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,076
...the officers' mail too?

548
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,315
Very well...

549
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,799
Aren't you going to open them Signore Capitano?
No!, I'm in a hurry.

550
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,791
CENSORED

551
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,395
Send this one back.
Yes, Signore Capitano.

552
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,552
I do not like to see himself
lose his head over a woman.

553
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,393
Yes Signore Capitano.

554
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,799
And today my letters came back.
Everyone that I'd ever written to her.

555
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,394
Came back?
Just marked return to sender.

556
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,279
Person unknown.
Well, that's very strange.

557
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,676
32 letters. She never got one.

558
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,479
Well, that's why she never wrote you.
No...

559
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,235
She'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

560
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,918
Have you tried...
I can't get any information at all.

561
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,798
I've got to go and find her, myself.

562
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,838
How can you?
I'm going to Milan. I'll find her.

563
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,709
Leave of absence forbidden
since that battle in the north again.

564
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,394
I'm going anyway.
that's desertion.

565
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,919
I don't care, I'm going.

566
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,674
You'll be caught.
You mustn't do this Frederico

567
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,310
Yes I must. That's what I wanted
to tell you padre.

568
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,032
What does this war mean to me
anymore?

569
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,872
What does anything mean, but
finding her.

570
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,873
But Frederico, consider the...
I can depend on you padre?

571
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,398
Say good-bye to Rinaldi and the
others for me.

572
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,074
When are you leaving?
Now. While they are at dinner.

573
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,749
And by morning when they miss me,
I'll be halfway to Milan.

574
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,231
If they ask me...what...do I say...
Anything you like.

575
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,713
Good-bye Father.

576
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,199
Good-bye Frederico.

577
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,790
May the Lord bless and preserve you.

578
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,512
What are you doing in the yards?

579
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,750
Looking for stragglers.
What do you do with them?

580
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,036
Send them back to fight invaders.

581
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,714
Every foot of Italian soil must be
regained.

582
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,678
Suppose they don't want to go back?
Then we shoot them.

583
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,512
Catherine?
Who's there?

584
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,548
Where's Catherine?

585
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,989
What are you doing back here?
Where's Catherine?

586
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,395
I know you. You run away.
You're a deserter.

587
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,279
Where is she? I've got to see her.
You can't. She's gone.

588
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,674
Gone! Where?
You'd better get out.

589
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,874
Has she been transferred?

590
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,396
If you don't get out of here, I'll
scream and bring the whole
hospital down on you.

591
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,791
Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
No!

592
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,871
Tell me where she is!
I hate you, understand? I won't tell you anything.

593
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,429
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you.

594
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,558
To pay you back for what you've
done to her. Making her have a baby.

595
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,394
Baby?
I warned you, but you didn't care.

596
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,393
Not about her.
Now she's had to go away.

597
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,473
Where? Where? For pity's sake, tell me.
Fergie!

598
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,517
No!
No, no!

599
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,079
Be carefull, girls.
Where is he?

600
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,151
And get me some clothes. A full outfit.

601
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,390
I can't go around in this uniform.

602
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,074
As long as I don't get mixed up in it
myself.

603
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,279
You won't. I just want you to get
some things and put an
advertisement in the newspaper for me.

604
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,750
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.

605
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,232
I know I shall have awful gas pains
in the morning as a result of this.

606
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,397
Just say..."Catherine, where are you?
I am free at last.

607
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,712
Meet me at the Palace Hotel, Stressa".

608
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,069
Signed Frederic.

609
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,157
The Major made an obituary
speech in your memory...

610
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,039
... and the priest wanted to
say mass for your soul.

611
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,395
Vermouth. One for you?
Two vermouth.

612
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,075
You see, we all thought you were
dead.

613
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,870
It never occurred to us that you
could be shell-shocked, wandered
away, lost your memory.

614
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,111
How did you find me?

615
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,794
I saw your advertisement in the paper.

616
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,438
But as soon as we knew,
we arranged everything.

617
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,400
Rinaldi will work on you,
one of his miraculous cures.

618
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,593
You will go back a hero.
I'm not going back.

619
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,558
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.

620
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,895
No.

621
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,151
I'm through the war. Get that
straight.

622
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,393
But you can't do that.

623
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,028
You can't say I am through with the war.
They will not let you do that.

624
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,474
Two vermouth.

625
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,112
Can I speak to you a moment sir?

626
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,788
It's all right Harry, he's my friend.
But..., I...

627
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,509
He's keep telling me it is dangerous
for me to stay here any longer.

628
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,073
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabinieri.

629
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,551
When will they come?
Tonight, tomorrow , who knows...but soon.

630
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,950
My boat is still ready sir.

631
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,589
Thank-you Harry.

632
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,070
If they arrest you, no one can save you.

633
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,832
I know that.
They will shoot you.

634
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,315
Look!

635
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,517
Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

636
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,472
I'm going to wait here until
I can find Catherine.

637
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,399
And how do you expect to do that?

638
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,949
I've got some people looking for her.

639
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,551
If that is more important than...
She's going to have a baby.

640
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,633
My baby.

641
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,376
So...

642
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,555
That means everything to you?

643
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,598
Yes, it would.

644
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,954
It means that I got to find her
and get her out of Italy.

645
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,596
Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.

646
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,557
What makes you say that?

647
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,599
She is in Switzerland.

648
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,496
Where?

649
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,677
Brissago.
Brissago?

650
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,274
Harry!

651
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,929
Will you do one for me too?
Yes madame. Step around here.

652
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,692
No. Just the head please.

653
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,997
Isn't there any mail for me yet?
Ah, madame.

654
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,278
Yes, yes today there are letters. Many letters.
Many!...oh!

655
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,033
20.
20! Well that was worth waiting for...

656
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,153
RETURN TO SENDER
CENSORED

657
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,999
It is off the lake. At the cross,
about 35 km.

658
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,720
I'll make it.
But at the frontier, there will be sentries.

659
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,348
I know.
And you will have to watch out for patrol boats

660
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,999
I will.
If it blows too hard...

661
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,991
I won't drown.

662
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,271
Have you enough money? Here.

663
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,999
Won't you need it?
There must be a Villa Rosa in Ponte None.

664
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,233
Always the same girls, until they
become like old friends. Like war comrades.

665
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,192
Take it baby, please, please.

666
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,398
You're a good egg, Reni.

667
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,279
No, I am not a good egg. I am a fool.

668
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,998
Soy un idiota.

669
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,790
But, if I had understood how you felt
about her...

670
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,028
Good luck baby.

671
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,228
Ciao baby.

672
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,995
It doesn't work.

673
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,795
Should I get a new cylinder doctor?
It is a new cylinder.

674
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,275
Oh I wanted so to have this baby
and not make any trouble...

675
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,669
...and now I'm all done...

676
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,076
All gone to pieces.

677
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,231
She is losing strength fast doctor.

678
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,550
There's no use. I'll have to operate.

679
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,391
That was lovely...

680
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,936
...Frederic...

681
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,969
darling...

682
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,390
You mustn't worry darling.

683
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,477
I'm not going to die now.

684
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,033
I got past the place where I was
going to die.

685
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,553
Are you glad?

686
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,157
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.

687
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,796
It's a cesarea.
We've been lucky to be on time.

688
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,913
Is she going to be all right?
Are you the husband?
Yes.

689
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,913
She kept calling for you all night. lt
would have been better if you'd been here.

690
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,550
I'm sorry...is she in danger?
She is very weak.

691
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,948
Do you suppose I could see her now?

692
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,395
Later...later.
It won't be long.

693
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,491
You can't die.

694
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,019
Did you call?

695
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,500
No, I didn't say anything.

696
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,455
Not yet.

697
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,698
Is she all right?
I hope so.

698
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,293
The baby?
A boy, but it was already dead
before she ever came in here.

699
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,569
But she'll be all right?
That's not in my hands any longer.

700
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,572
Go across the street and get
yourself some breakfast.

701
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,892
You look as if you need it.
It will be some time before she can see you.

702
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,699
You've had children?
What was it like?

703
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,851
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

704
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,489
Nothing.

705
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,572
Some coffee please and a brioche.

706
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,455
It's in the papers. Italy has won.
Thank God it's over.

707
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,890
This is the beginning of the end...

708
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,211
...but it will be a long time before
they can rebuild...

709
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,052
...what's been destroyed.

710
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,178
In the early morning hours of
November 4th...

711
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,856
the Austrio-Hungarian supreme command...

712
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,649
...accepted the armistice conditions
laid down by the General Badoglio.

713
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,979
Don't let her die.

714
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:44,498
Oh God, please don't let her die.

715
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,293
I'll do anything for you, if you don't
let her die.

716
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:52,491
You took the baby...that was all
right..

717
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,736
...but don't let her die.

718
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,569
Please, please...

719
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,097
...dear God, don't let
her die.

720
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,857
Her husband's out there.

721
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,699
Might as well let him in.

722
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,858
I knew he was coming.

723
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,768
When I went under, I knew he was here.

724
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,692
You won't tell him will you?

725
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,729
Tell him what?

726
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,898
That I'm going to die.

727
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,578
No, we won't tell him.

728
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,596
Thank-you.

729
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,590
Doctor...

730
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,495
...have I long?

731
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,093
Don't you see?

732
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,293
I have to know.

733
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,934
Not long.

734
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,928
Let him come in.

735
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:31,854
No wait.

736
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,456
Could I have my bag first?

737
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,293
Such a mess.

738
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,291
He never liked me to be pale.

739
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,533
You can go in now.

740
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,699
Catherine...

741
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,735
Darling...

742
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,615
You're all right?
I'm fine.

743
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,297
Did you worry about me?

744
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:43,413
I came as soon as I found where
you were.

745
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,979
Poor darling...

746
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,853
Let me look at you.

747
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,534
You're wet and tired...

748
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,250
Sit down now darling...here...

749
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,538
You're going to be all right
Catherine.

750
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,292
Do you want me to do anything
Cat?

751
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,610
Can I get you anything?
No.

752
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,452
Just talk to me.

753
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,490
Tell me that you haven't stopped
loving me.

754
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,290
You know I couldn't stop.

755
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,416
I like to hear you say it though.

756
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,452
I'll never stop loving you.

757
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,095
Never?

758
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,297
Not even.....if I died.

759
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,899
Never!

760
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,936
I want you to have other girls.

761
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:47,173
I don't want them.
That's right dear.

762
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,979
Try to sleep, Cat.

763
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,293
When I get well...

764
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:08,254
...we'll take a little house in the
mountains...

765
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,332
We always planned a house of our
own, remember?

766
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,296
I'll get you a fine house.

767
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,293
We'll live in it until the war is over.

768
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,297
Then you'll go back to America and
be a splendid architect.

769
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,458
We'll be married all over again...in
a church.

770
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,735
In a church.

771
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,410
Darling...
...I'm going to die.

772
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,494
Don't let me die.

773
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,379
Cat!
Take me in your arms...

774
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,693
...hold me tight. Don't let me go...
Cat...

775
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,970
It's dark out there alone.

776
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,690
I don't want to leave you anymore.
I've been alone so much.

777
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,693
You can't die. You're too brave to die.

778
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,809
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

779
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,939
Yes...I...
...I am a brave girl.

780
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,376
Whatever happens, you'll not be
afraid.

781
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,371
I'll not be afraid.

782
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:23,018
We've never been apart. Really.
Not since we met.

783
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,212
Not since we met.

784
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,611
We never can be.
Never parted.

785
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,614
In life and in death.
Say it, Cat!

786
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,094
In life and in death,...

787
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,652
...we'll never be parted.

788
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,980
You do believe that, don't you, Cat?

789
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,690
I believe it...

790
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,657
...and I'm not afraid.

791
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,095
Peace...

792
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,089
Peace.
